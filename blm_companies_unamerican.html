    <h1>Unamerican companies and organizations that are destroying our freedoms</h1>

    <p>Our freedom of speech is being denied. You should hold these companies and organizations responsible and let them know they are being unamerican.</p>

    <h2>State of California</h2>

    <p>California used to be the example for the rest of the country. If California were a country, it would be the 5 largest economy in the world with several of the largest corporations in the world. As such, it should be the example but sadly it has politicians.</p>

    It's the leader in the <span class="hilite">lowest 5% in education</span>

    <h2>Nike</h2>
    <p>Nike is about destroying america. <a target="news" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-nixes-betsy-ross-flag-sneaker-after-colin-kaepernick-intervenes-11562024126">All reminders of slavery must be destoyed including the American flag</a>. White people are a reminder of slavery. Could they be next?</p> 

    <p>Freedom of speech is the right of everyone but during work hours employee's are representing the company and company values. As an employee, you do not have the right impose your values on a company. <a target="news" href="https://www.vox.com/2018/9/4/17818148/nike-boycott-kaepernick">"Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything"</a> supports employee's who violate an employer's right to freedom of speech. Nike is making money by abusing an employer's name, values and reputation.</p> 

    <h2>Google</h2>

    <p>They are black mailing and extorting companies which is illegal and the same tactics used by Nazi Germany.</p>

    <p>They are denying Americans of their freedom of speech and constitutional right to a fair trial. Clearly, by extorting companies to censor their content, Google cannot be trusted to censor fairly. Those people who have been censored cannot hold Google accountable through the courts.</p>

    <h2><a target="news" href="lulac.org">League of United Latin American Citizens</a></h2>

    <p>This organization is <a target="news" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/10/ted-cruz-goya-boycott-ceo-praise-trump-after-nike-boycott/">blackmailing and extorting americans and their companies such as Goya foods</a> which is a tactic used by Nazi Germany.</p>

    <h2><a target="news" href="adl.org">ADL (Anti-Defimation League)</a> and all companies supporting it</h2>

    <p>This organization has been notified about the Black Lives Matter defimation of the police, yet they don't speak out against those values and "Stand in solidarity with the black community".  An organization that states "standing in solidarity with our most deeply held American values of freedom, equality and justice" but then tells companies like facebook they must censor anything that the ADL deems inapproriate. </p>
