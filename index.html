    <h2>Racism against the police is still racism<br/>
      You're racist because of "Black Lives Matter" deception</h2>

    <p>The Washington Post does not want you to realize that <span class="hilite">police are murdered at 90 times the rate of unarmed blacks killed by police</span> and 15 times the rate of armed blacks killed by police. The Washington Post felt black violence is irrelevant and that blacks being killed by police at 2 times the rate of white people clearly does not imply systemic police racism and excessive police violence.</p>

    <h2>Black Lives Matter is not about saving black lives</h2>

    <p>Black Lives Matter has lost sight of their true goal. If they were truly about saving and improving black lives, then they would support gun control. 7,000 black people are murdered by gun each year. You would save more lives in 1 year than you could possibly save in 100 years by defunding police.</p>

    <h2>Some black people are against Black Lives Matter</h2>

    <p>You'll see facts and data below but you need to hear first hand from some black conservatives.  <a target="news" href="https://theofficertatum.com/">Ex-officer Tatum</a> has a large following, is a public speaker and appears on news programs. The following video is 2 hours where he and 3 guests discuss current topics such as Black Lives Matter. They speak about children and babies being murdered. Violence and the hardships of living in a black community that cannot be fixed by Black Lives Matter. While watching the video, I want you to think about his friends. If he has 1,000 white male friends, then he expects 1 will be murdered during his life but if he has 1,000 black male friends, then he expects 27 to be murdered during his life.</p>

    <p>Americans want to help the black community but nothing will help until the black community is willing to fix the violence.</p>

    <p>A few famous black people talk about racism.</p>

    <p>To hell with American liberties, freedoms and democracy. Black people will re-write history when libraries and schools re-open.

    <h2>My fact finding turned into lies, deceit and very likely conspiracy</h2>

    <p>Like you, I was disgusted by George Floyd's death which made me more sensitive to Black Lives Matter. I trusted the news media reports until I saw that Washington Post graph (republished by news agencies around the world such as the German news program Tagesschau). I found an obvious error that started me checking some of the facts.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span class="hilite" style="border: 2px solid black; font-size: x-large;">&nbsp; 1/2 truth + 1/2 truth &#x2260; truth &nbsp;</span> </p>

    <p><span class="hilite"> One error turned into an avalanche of deception.</span> I found that Black Lives Matter is completely deceiving us. Lies of omission are still lies. Nearly everyone is participating in the deception:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Black people: An example is the 100 black VA hospital employee's demanding management be fired because of black discrimination at the hospital. Any reported discrimination will be vigorously handled by the <a target="news"
        href="https://www.va.gov/ORM/HPP.asp">"Office of Resolution Management, Diversity & Inclusion"</a> and protected by the "NO FEAR ACT". How can black employee's blame management when they couldn't be bothered to report discrimination!</li>
      <li>Companies: Apple CEO declaring he will fight discrimination within Apple but he obviously never discussed Apples policies with the HR department. The <a target="news" href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">EEOC</a> requires companies eliminate all forms of discrimination. I know for a fact that most companies take this very seriously.</li>
      <li>Universities: their deceptions were the most appalling. These so called scholars write research papers specifically to be used by Black Lies Matter. For example, the research paper <a target="news"
        href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6708348/">"Risk of being killed by police use of
        force"</a> says it's about "risk" but the only risk discussed is being black! Apparently having a gun is not a risk factor.</li>
      <li>News media: They use exagerated number like 1,200 black deaths instead of saying 40 unarmed black deaths each year or 250 armed black deaths each year. They are using horribly flawed information to specifically prove Black Lies Matter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The truth is that racism is being blown out of proportion by black people. Sadly there are bad people in the world and racism exists but the destruction of democracy and America is being led by lies and deceit that are far more destructive. <span class="hilite"> I'm appalled we can't get truthful information because people are too passionate about Black Lives Matter.</span></p> 
      
      
    <p>To help you find the complete truth, I've included data, facts, information and sources.</p>

    <h2>The Washington Post falsely claims "overwhelming evidence"</h2>
    
    <p>The Washington Post ignores it's motto "Democracy dies in Darkness" because they are diehard Black Lives Matter supporters. Articles like <a target="news" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/if-you-dont-believe-systemic-racism-is-real-explain-these-statistics/2020/06/12/ce0dff6e-acc7-11ea-94d2-d7bc43b26bf9_story.html">"If you don't believe systemic racism is real, then explain these statistics"</a> claim "overwhelming evidence" but I'll show much of this evidence is either fabricated or woefully incomplete.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><span class="hilite">This graph is used by news outlets throughout the world.</span></div>
    <p>From this graph, you clearly see black and hispanic genocide by the police.</p>

    <img src="washington_post_graph.png" style="height: 100mm; border: 2px solid black; margin: auto; display: block;">

    <p>Really sly. Their fact checkers ignored the hispanic population error. After using the correct population, Hispanics are very similar to whites and other races are lower than whites. Simalarly, they never mention on the graph that the numbers are 5 years total. Are they saying police are only racist against black people? Even worse, are they only racist against black men?</p>

      </div>

    <p>80% of the people killed by police are armed and considered dangerous. New York is reducing it's police force which will put police lives in a lot more danger. Black people can expect their situation to get worse because police won't be willing to take the risk.</p>

    <p>Everyone forget's police are involved. In the previous graph 80% of the people killed by police had a weapon (armed). George Floyd would be in the 20% that did not have a weapon (unarmed). More important is to consider police that die and get injured in these confrontations.</p>

    <p>Black Lives Matter insisted these graphs be per capita for 2015 to 2019. Dividing these numbers by 5 makes them much smaller and using real numbers per year puts it more into perspective. Let's look at a few.</p>

    <h2>Black arrests are NOT based on race</h2>

    <p>Violent crimes such as murder exclude the possibility of racism, black tax and white privilege. Since all other types of crime follow the same pattern for black and white people, the police are arresting black people based on crimes and NOT "systemic police racism". Decide for yourself by looking at all the <a target="news" href="blm_fbi_arrests.html">FBI arrests data and graphs</a>.
 
    <p>This small quick look shows proof that hispanics and other races don't experience excessive discrimination claimed by black people.<p>

  <h2>Conspiracy, ignorance, fact, fiction or opinion</h2>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><span class="hilite" style="border: 2px solid black;">
      &nbsp; If all you look for is racism, then racism is the only thing you will find &nbsp; </span></p>

  <p>To this point, you've seen errors that could be claimed as mistakes or not relevant even though they clearly are relevant. There is so called evidence that has clearly been fabricated. Some of the authors could probably be sued for libel by the police since there is absolutely no evidence of systemic police racism. You can decide for yourself.</p>

  <p>Obama, Universities, professors, the Washington Post and various governmental departments appear to have participated in denying Americancs of their liberties, destory democracy and causing riots. Most hid their contributions to create this situation.</p>
  
  <h2>Conspiracy or ignorance? Research paper 2019<br/><a target="news" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6708348/">"Risk of being killed by police use of force"</a></h2> 
  
      <p>Anyone claiming police racism from this research paper has committed libel. The word "Racism" has been intentionally omitted. The only conclusion claimed is "nontrivial lifetime risk of being killed by police". A single death is never considered trivial. It is the reader who interprets this as racism.  </p>
      
      There is little doubt that this paper is a conspiracy. The only conclusion drawn was specifically for black people.</p>
      
      <p>Curious that professors from 3 universities considered race and age are the only risk factors. Children could easily name more risk factors such as guns.<p>
      
      <p>Curious how they manipulate the numbers. For instance, life course means to divide by 70 years to get a yearly number. Confusing numbers are used heavily in this paper.</p>

      <p>Curious this paper does not mention 80% had weapons.</p>

      <p>Curious this paper talks about police violence but does not mention black violence. For instance, over the "life course" of a black boy, 1 in 37 will be murdered. Talk to 2 classroom's of black children about risk, and you must tell the boys one of them will be murdered.</p>

      <p>Curious that the NIH sponsored this research paper.</p>
      
      <p>Curious this paper came out 2 years after Obama was president.</p>
        
      <p>Curious that the media's most used supporting documentation is this research paper which does not prove a single thing or come to a real conclusion about race or racism.</p>
      
      <p>Is this paper criminally responsibile for the riots and destruction that is occurring today? At the very least, it should be held criminally responsible for inciting civil disobedience, libel against every police officer who is not racist and endangering a democratically appointed police force.</p>

      <h2>Conspiracy or ignorancce <br/> 1 in every 1,000 black boys can expect to be killed by police </h2>

      <p>As Black Lives Matter puts it, "Over the life course, about 1 in every 1,000 black men can expect to be killed by
        police". Clearly this must be black genocide by the police. You can hold your head high because you are fighting
        the good fight. Black boys should run up and thank you for saving so many black lives.</p>

      <p>Most people have tunnel vision and only see the obvious. Black Lives Matter tells the parts of the truth they
        want you too see. Systemic police racism is proven by "Over the life course, about 1 in every 1,000 black men can
        expect to be killed by police".</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They say "over the life course" instead of simply saying "over 70 years".</li>
        <li>"black men" should have been "black boys" but that would raise questions.</li>
        <li>They left out the word "average" black boy so they could say 1 in 1,000. 80% of these deaths were due to
          attacking the officer. These are NOT the black men you can save. Disarming police will definitely reduce these
          black deaths but it will increase police deaths.</li>
        <li>The average black boy won't have a gun in his lifetime, so his risk is 1 in 12,000. These are the black boys /
          men you are trying to save. </li>
        <li>You ignored that 1 in 37 black boys will be murdered. That's 324 in 12,000. Be proud because you saved 1 black
          man from the police and allowed 324 black men get murdered. You should be really proud you reduced the police
          force which will result in more murder. Be proud the life you saved is now being murdered.</li>
        <li>35% to 50% of the murders go unsolved. You should be really proud you reduced the police force and allowed
          more murders to go unsolved.</li>
        <li>1 in 1,000 white boys will be murdered. Who is the racist here because 27 black boys will be murdered for 1
          murdered white.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Black Lives Matter usually tells the truth. You need to <span class="hilite"> decide if it's a complete truth you
          can trust. Ask yourself if your blaming racism when the problem is violence.</span></p>
  
      <h2>Conspiracy or ignorance? Research paper 2020:<br/> <a target="news"
          href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0858-1">racial disparities in police stops across the
          United States</a></h2>

      <p>Anyone claiming police racism from this research paper has committed libel. Again, the word "Racism" has been intentionally omitted. The word "suggest" occurs 21 times which tells you they cannot draw any conclusion. The only conclusion claimed is "Creating a national database of traffic stops" but they never say anything about the database requirements or the information needed in the database. They say "‘veil of darkness’ masks one’s race" to insinuate police racism when it could just as easily be reduced fear, possibly police shift change or many other possible inferences.</p>

      <p>Curious this paper was published 3 years after Obama was president.</p>

      <p>Curious that multiple Obama advisers graduated from Stanford University.</p>

      <p>Curious that these researchers are located at Standford University in Palo Alto but never compared policing between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto. East Palo Alto was the murder capital of the USA for a period of time. East Palo Alto currently has 4.3 times the violence of Palo Alto. Since black people have a lot of violence, these researchers could have easily gained first hand insight of the effect of violence on an officer's decisions and demeanor.<a target="news" href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/palo-alto/crime">Palo alto violent crimes is 1 in 901</a> versus <a target="news" href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/east-palo-alto/crime">East Palo Alto violent crimes is 1 in 209</a>. More than 4.3 times the violence per capita.</p>

      <p>Curious that for a research paper to be published, it requires a conclusion which they had to fabricate. They couldn't bother describing what that database needed. Why did so many professors bother to publish this paper, especially now that Black Lives Matter has become front page news?</p>

      <p>This paper was written specifically to falsely support Black Lives Matter. This paper is not about how police choose who to stop. It is specifically trying to imply police are stopping blacks more often than whites so you will conclude racism. The simple fact is the #1 cause of black men under 44 is MURDER. You will see black communities have pandemic violence which requires more police who will be stopping more people.</p>

      <h2>Conspiracy or ignorance? research paper 2019: <br/> <a target="news" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0027968419301300?via%3Dihub">"Racial Residential Segregation and Black-White Disparities in Fatal Police Shootings"</a></h2>

      <p>Anyone claiming police racism from this research paper has committed libel. Again, the word "Racism" has been intentionally omitted.</p>

      <p>The conclusion is flawed: "Efforts to ameliorate the problem of fatal police violence must move beyond the individual level and consider the interaction between law enforcement officers and the neighborhoods that they police".
        
      <p>First flaw "neighborhood violence" is ignored when talking about police violence. Black neighborhoods are inherently dangerous because of pandemic black violence. 1 in 37 black boys will be murdered in an average life time. For black males under 44, the #1 cause of death is murder. Arrests for black murderers is 4.5 the rate of white murderers.</p>

      <p>The second flaw is "neighborhood interaction". The first priority is officer safety in gun obsessed neighborhoods. 80% of the black male murder victims were shot by gun. Black people are arrested for firearms 3 times the rate of white people. These are not white privilege, black tax or racist crimes.</p>
      
      <p>Curious this paper came out 2 years after Obama left office.</p>

      <h2>Conspiracy or coincidence?<br/> Ex-president Obama</h2>
      
      <p>I don't have any direct evidence linking Obama to a conspiracy but there are too many coincidenses to ignore the possibility. Research papers and the Washington Post are directly responsible for spreading so much misleading information that has resulted in dissolution of democratically appointed police, denying Americans of their liberties and freedom's, falsely accusing police of racism, intentionally inciting riots, inciting civil unrest and other criminal activities.</p>

      <p>Curious that multiple research papers were published before George Floyds death but a couple years after Obama left office. Also realize that no research papers before Obama's presidency hinted specifically to systemic racism.</p>

      <p>Notice that during the Obama administration, the Washington Post located in Washington DC became a very active supporter of Black Lives Matter.</p>

      <p>Obama felt that Black lives Matter is more important than truth and liberties. <a target="news"
          href="http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/attitudes/motivated-reasoning/#:~:text=Motivated%20reasoning%20is%20a%20form,or%20endorse%20a%20preferred%20conclusion.">

          Crowd mentality</a> gave him the justification to knowingly plant fabricated evidence in support of Black
        Lives Matter.</p>

      <p><span class="hilite">If Obama feels justified to exagerate information to support Black Lives Matter, then you must seriously question the morality of people who feel equally justified. The end result has been the destruction of democracy, Riots and protesting are lasting weeks longer than Ferguson. It has destroyed "innocent until proven guilty".</p>

      <h2>Conspiracy or ignorance? Washington Post article:<br><a target="news" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/if-you-dont-believe-systemic-racism-is-real-explain-these-statistics/2020/06/12/ce0dff6e-acc7-11ea-94d2-d7bc43b26bf9_story.html">"If you don’t believe systemic racism is real, explain these statistics"</a>. </h2>
          
      <p>It's appalling that the Washington Post was once a prestigious paper but can't do balanced reporting. They fully support Black Lives Matter but never mention the cost it has taken on democracy. Below, I discuss losing the freedom of speech, the demise of democracy and the loss of liberties we hold so dear. They are not capable understanding the research papers they claim as overwhelming evidence. Their fact checkers can't even check facts or maybe they can but they needed to prove a point.</p>

      <h2>Conspiracy or ignorance?<br>racial inequality by failing to hire Black people</h2>

      <p>Apple's black employee <a target="news" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/17/george-floyd-protests-black-lives-matter-employees-corporate-america-racism/3195685001/">Tanya Faison says Apple is "failing to hire, promote or fairly pay Black people and people of color"</a>. This is a sentiment of many black people.</p>

      <p>Most black people <a target="news" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/between-the-lines/201801/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-entitlement">feel entitlement</a>. In Tanya's case, she feels Apple's CEO Tim Cook must be part of the Black Lives Matter solution which has nothing to do with Apple. If she bothered to ask HR about diversity and discrimination policies, she would have found they are religously enforced.</p>

      <p>Similarly at Facebook, management decided that freedom of speech outweighed the deletion of Trumps posts. Facebook employee's who support Black Lives Matter are using their entitlement to <a target="news" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html">stage a virtual walkout</a>.</p>

      <p>Companies don't want employee's who feel entitlement. Look at mega-corporations in silicon valley (e.g. Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Oracle, Intel and ...). They hire asians using H1B visas to avoid hiring black people because of their entitlement. They are not being racist. Employee's are hired to do a job, not dictate corporate policy.</p>

      <p>By law, companies must have a diverse staff. Since entitlement does not work well in company culture, black people are often excluded because they are a bad fit. H1B visas are a hassle but mega-corporations get employee's who fit into their culture. Black people need to lose their entitlement to become more employable.</p>

      <h2>Conspiracy or ignorance?<br>racial inequality by failing to hire, promote or fairly pay Black people</h2>

      <p>Most <span class="hilite">company HR departments are trained and prepared to deal immediately with any type of discrimination</span>. They are required by law to discourage all discrimination and they take it very seriously. In addition, employee's can file a discrimination complaint with the <a target="news" href="www.eeoc.gov">EEOC</a>. It will be investigated and corrective action will be taken where necessary. To avoid dealing with the EEOC, most companies go to great lengths to discourage all discrimination. Anyone filing a discrimination complaint is protected from retaliation. </p>

      <p>As for <span class="hilite"> governmental agencies, they have similar similar protections for discrimination</span>. For example, the VA has the <a target="news" href="https://www.va.gov/ORM/HPP.asp">"Office of Resolution Management, Diversity & Inclusion"</a> which will
      seriously and vigorously handle that claim. Their only job is to deal with discrimination claims. Anyone filing a claim is protected from retaliation by the "NO FEAR ACT".</p>

      <h2>Conspiracy or ignorance: <br/> Black privilege and white guilt</h2>
      
      <p>White privilege and the black tax has not existed for years. Instead, look at Apple and you easily <a target="news" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/17/george-floyd-protests-black-lives-matter-employees-corporate-america-racism/3195685001/"> see black privilege and white guilt</a>. Apple's black employee Tanya faison is addament that Apple must play a role in Black Lives Matter and she certainly has not looked into a single corporate policy with regards to discrimination and diversity. CEO Tim Cook is yielding to black pressure to take action when his company already has policies in place to handle diversity and discrimination. </p>


      <h2>Conspiracy or ignorance? <br/> Americans denied their constitutional rights</h2>

      <p>The fifth amendment to the American constitution is "due process of law". Americans can't hold Black Lives Matter accountable in
        court. There is no organization or person to be held culpable for crimes of this organization. <span class="hilite"> There are thousands
        of criminal acts that will never be prosecuted.</span></p>
  
      <p>Police officers are being fired without any due process. Obviously, the lead officer was in the wrong in
        killing George Floyd. The other officers were there but the extent of their participation is in question. They
        were in the impossible situation of not having any control but being held resposible. Any choice they made was
        going to be wrong. They were fired without any due process of the law.</p>

      <p>Democracy is being ignored. The destruction and removal anything Black Lives Matter deems unacceptable. E.g. statues being removed without public approval.  </p>
        

      <p>At the demand of Black Lives Matter, governmental agencies ignore due process and innocent until proven guilty.</p>
  
      <h2>Conspiracy or ignorance? <br/> overthrow of democratically appointed police force</h2>
  
      <p>Black Lives Matter is making false accusations against the police. They claim "systemic police racism" and black genocide by the police. <span class="hilite"> Black Lives Matter can't be prosecuted for slander, libel, and defamation of character</span>. I'm not a
        lawyer but I suspect there are many other laws being broken.</p>
        
      <h2>Stop being white guilted into believing bad information</h2>

          Companies are declaring again they will fight systemic racism in their work place and around the world.</a>
        These CEO's and presidents can't be bothered to ask about their company policies. Instead, they take responsibility which re-enforces black entitlement. These CEO's and presidents are not helping to make black people more employable. Instead, they are making the problem worse.</p>

        <h2>Passionate people are dangerous</h2>

  <p>Black Lies Matter is resulting in useless bureaucracy on top of existing bureaucracy that will only be more
    confusing. This will never help black people who can't use the existing bureaucracy.</p>

  <p>You must be leary of people who are too passionate. Passion allows a normally trustworthy person to be
    untrustworthy (knowingly or unknowingly). "Black Lives Matter" enflames such great passion that you must view everything with extreme suspicion and choose with great care what you trust. I ask you to scrutinize everything about "Black Lives Matter". Sources are given as much as possible so you can decide for yourself. Typically, you must take a
    person at their word because they don't include sources.</p>

    <h2>Police aren't committing black genocide<br/>
      This is pandemic violence within the black community</h2>

    <p>As you've seen, police are not killing black people because of their race. Sadly, the black
      community has been dealing with pandemic violence for years. The exhaustion of dealing with this violence has them
      lashing out at anyone they can blame. The police were intentionally given as the lamb to this slaughter.</p>

      Jose Policemen fired for exercising their freedom of speech</a></h2>

  <p>Where is the ACLU for this agregious denial of their freedom of speech. They lost their jobs for speaking their
    mind. Many may not like what these police officer said but are we saying there is absolutely no merrit? Look at some of
    their their remarks which may be offensive but actually have value. Worse yet, these were private posts and
    someone did a screen copy to post these on the internet.</p>

  <p><span class="hilite" style="border: 2px solid black;"> &nbsp; Black Lives Matter protestors are the "enemy"
      &nbsp; </span></p>

  <p>For police officers, protestors are the enemy. Police are losing their rights, asked to take
    more risk and risk jail for making the wrong decision in very difficult circumstances. How are they not the enemy?</p>

  <p><span class="hilite" style="border: 2px solid black;"> &nbsp; Black Lives Matter protestors are "un-american"
      &nbsp; </span></p>

  <p>Look at the ACLU section above. People in this movement specifically abuse our rights to achieve their goals.
    Additionally, these policemen lost their jobs because they exercised their freedom of speech by government
    officials who don't want to anger these protestors. Denying people their civil liberties is un-american.</p>

  <p><span class="hilite" style="border: 2px solid black;"> &nbsp; Black Lives Matter protestors are "racist idiots"
      &nbsp; </span></p>

  <p>Protestors are certainly racist against all police. They want to put the police into more danger. Every
    questionable decision now results in immediate criminal charges without looking at the evidence. Many are willing
    to abuse policemen without cause.</p>

  <p>The real question is whether protestors are idiots. They ignore that 1 in every 37 black boys will be murdered.
    They ignore that police die 30 times the rate of black men. They ignore violence in the black community (e.g.
    9,000 murders per year). They ignore they could save 7,000 black people murdered by gun each year by supporting
    gun control. They ignore that there are existing solutions against racism. Protestors ignore there is always 2
    sides to any conflict and they are guilty of ignoring the other side. Protestors are certainly ignorant. As for
    being idiots, the jury is still out. Source: these items are discussed below in detail.</p>

  <p><span class="hilite" style="border: 2px solid black;"> &nbsp; “Black lives don’t really matter.” and “I say
      re-purpose the hijabs into nooses.” &nbsp; </span></p>

  <p>These are very racist and derogotory but remember that "Black Lives Matter" is equally racist and derogotory.
    This phrase now evokes white lives don't matter and white people will need to die for their cause. It's very close
    to being libel because it identifies all police as being un-american. Clearly black people feel there is meaning
    associated to the confederate flag so they must agree that Black Lives Matter has meaning to white people.
    Legally, all postings regarding "Black Lives matter" must be censored if they censor opposing points of view.</p>

    <h2>We've established that Protestors are ignorant<br />
      They should be part of the solution instead of complainers</h2>

    <p>Protestors need to be the solution instead of demanding others be the solution. Make a meaningful contribution!
      Look at some examples how protesting is often meaningless.</p>

    <p>If you are protesting for the <a target="news"
        href="https://fox4kc.com/news/protest-expands-over-discrimination-claims-at-kansas-citys-va-medical-center/?fbclid=IwAR00-tKUHQVpwcb3sS7iUhDFNEFp9I6B0xuQn0osi27HtE_LuR8Y9W3ZvGA">100
        black people who claim discrimination at Kansas city VA medical center</a> then <span class="hilite">help these
        black people report this discrimination</span> to the <a target="news"
        href="https://www.va.gov/ORM/HPP.asp">"Office of Resolution Management, Diversity & Inclusion"</a> which will
      seriously and vigorously handle that claim. Their only job is to deal with discrimination claims. If the black
      person is afraid of retaliation, then teach them about how the <span class="hilite">"NO FEAR ACT"</span> protects
      them.</p>

    <p>If discrimination within any federal agency is not being handled correctly, then <span class="hilite">demand the
        office of diversity and inclusion do their job correctly</span>. This is their one and only job. Stop demanding
      a complete change in management when the office of diversity and inclusion can't do their job correctly. You are
      being the racist that you are fighting.</p>

    <p>If you are protesting the police, then <span class="hilite">reduce the need for police to confront black
        people</span>. You could demand gun control because 7,000 black people are killed by guns each year. You could
      support gun control because 56,000 black people are arrested for weapons each year. You could save black children
      from being murdered (#1 cause of death at 35% of the black child deaths). You could save thousands of black people
      under 45 years old by finding a solution to MURDER (#1 cause of death for black people under 45 years old).</p>

    <p>If you are protesting racism within white people, then teach black people <span class="hilite">how to ask instead
        of demand</span> change. Below, I mention the black teaching assistant who doesn't realize "Some white people
      may have to die" is a very bad thing.</p>

    <p>If you are protesting companies , then help black people understand how to <span class="hilite">deal with racism
        in their company</span>. Rarely will companies tolerate racism in their workplace. Black employee's like Apple's

    <h2>Black people protest but never take real action</h2>

    <p>Real american's use the court to protect their rights. If you are experiencing discrimination that is not being resolved, then be a real american and protect your rights against discrimination. While you have the right to protest, it is nothing more than blaming others and telling them to fix the problem. Racism will only end when black people empower themselves instead of entitling themselves. Use the courts to protect everyone from discrimination.</p>

    <p>Most blacks believe <a target="news" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/17/george-floyd-protests-black-lives-matter-employees-corporate-america-racism/3195685001/">"for years stayed silent on systemic racism while perpetuating racial inequality"</a>. This is ignorance and black entitlement.</p>
    
    <p><span class="hilite">Black people are in complete denial about the monumental achievements against discrimination.</span> They think america has stayed silent for years. They can't admit any progress otherwise they would not have anyone to blame for their problems within the black community such as pandemic Violence. Violence so pandemic that blacks are murdered about 5 times the white murder rate.</p> 
      
    <p>Most company HR departments have been trained to deal with discrimination. They have company policies to quickly and effectively deal with all discrimination. There are laws to ensure companies eradicate all discrimination and ensure they have a diverse workforce. If companies fail to comply, then anyone who experiences discrimination needs to file a complaint with the <a target="news" href="www.eeoc.gov">EEOC.GOV</a>. This government agency's only job is to eradicate discrimination and they will take the appropriate action for all claims of discrimination. In fact, there is a law that protects anyone who files a complaint from retaliation.</p>

    <p>All government agencies are required by law to resolve all issues involving discrimination. Each has a department to correct all discrimination.  For instance, the VA has <a target="news"

    <h2>Today's meaning of "racism" and "Black Lives Matter"</h2>

    <p>Today, "racism" or "Black Lives Matter" evokes black genocide by police and police brutality. Are we blaming a
      group of people for the sins of a few? Are we denying democratic rights? Are we supressing freedom of speech? Are
      we supporting brutality and terrorism? Have we forgotten why "innocent until proven guilty" exists?</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span class="hilite" style="border: 2px solid black;">
        &nbsp; We have become the racist we fight. &nbsp;
      </span></p>

    <p>I ask you to consider what you are saying by using the words "racism" and "Black Lives Matter" in todays world.
      Below is a quick list of facts and effects. Americans support your freedom to embrace "Black Lives Matter" but
      <span class="hilite">we hold you responsible for immorality caused by your choice</span>. Ignorance is not an
      excuse.</p>

      <h2>Social media makes You, a leader of the <br/> "Black Lives Matter" political party</h2>

      <p>Social media and the internet has given you a powerful voice. Every share you make has your powerful of approval.
        Look at the facts below and ask yourself if you share any guilt.</p>
  
      <h2>If and when you realize "Black Lives Matter" has
        <br />crossed the line that must never be crossed
      </h2>
  
      <p>Be vigilant as a supporter of "Black Lives Matter" because you've accepted that responsibility. Always ask if
        lines have been crossed that should never be crossed. Ask yourself if you are guilty of not speaking against
        something that has become far worse than racism.
      </p>

    <h2>Should ACLU be renamed BACLU?</h2>

    <p>ACLU.org states they are the nation’s premier defender of the rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.
      The ACLU has protected American liberties for 100 years and in last 3 months, the ACLU has ignored the loss of
      liberties they fought to ensure and we hold dear.</p>

    <p>Where is the ACLU when in the name of "Black Lives Matter", millions could have their Freedom of speech denied,
      be censored, denied the opportunity for a fair trial and probably denied other freedoms and rights.</p>

    <p>An avid believer in Freedom of speech, <a target="news"
        href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/here-are-all-the-brands-not-advertising-on-facebook/">Facebook management
        is being extorted by several companies to suppress controversial posts!</a> Even some facebook employee's have
      stated "There isn't a neutral position on racism". Facebook management is correct that employee's can't be trusted
      with such decisions. The ACLU must speak out in support of Facebook Management otherwise it will be like twitter
      and others that suppress whatever they deem inappropriate.</p>

    <p>The opposite is Twitter which ignores freedom of speech.</p>

    <p>Google is extorting companies to remove disparaging "Black Lives Matter" content but they must leave Black Lives
      Matter content.</p>

    <p>The ACLU is a racist organization. Don't they realize that the research papers only state "more blacks than white
      per capita"! By saying black people, they are ignoring "WHITE people are also being murdered and brutalized by
      police with near impunity". There is no evidence that demonstrates only black people are mistreated. For that
      matter, there is no evidence supporting "impunity". 1 in 1,000 is not impunity. 1 in 38 is impunity. They never
      mention that police are murdered and brutalize. As lawyers, don't they realize they shouldn't make unsubstantiated
      claims?</p>

    <p>Obama, universities, professors and the government have fabricated research papers to deny the police of their
      liberties and freedom's. They are responsible for accusing all police of racism without a single fact. They are
      responsible for the spread of misleading information and drawing conclusions they know are not true.</p>

    <p>For me personally, I lost my local farmers market because of coercion. They had a strict policy of "no politics"
      and yet were forced out of business when they would not make an exception for racism.</p>

    <p>There are thousands of examples of "Black Lives Matter" being a non-democratic movement. Taco Bell being coerced
      into allowing "Black Lives Matter" attire. Closing down public streets illegally. Closing down freeways.</p>

    <h2>Missing freedom of speech in universities and colleges</h2>

    <p>Obama has said that universities and colleges are now about political correctness instead of free and open speech

    <p>Most black people are good people but many feel spilling white blood will be necessary to achieve black equity as
      opposed to equality.</p>

    <h2>There's a big difference between pandemic violence and racism</h2>

    <p>To call this problem racism shows that we are ignoring the morality within the black community.</p>

    <p>Over the years, we've become numb to the pandemic black violence and we no longer discuss this violence. <span
        class="hilite">The only thing that hasn't changed over the years is black violence.</span> The graph showed the
      black community in trouble with it's morals. The numbers below continue to tell this story of extreme and
      excessive violence. For years, all attempts in lowering the violence have failed.</p>

    <h2>Black perception of racism is not the reality</h2>

    <p>The VA can't have a black racism problem and those protesting the VA clearly don't understand the safeguards in
      place for black employees. the "NO FEAR ACT" and the <a target="news"
        href="https://www.va.gov/ORM/HPP.asp">"Office of Resolution Management, Diversity & Inclusion"</a> to vigorously

    <p>This sounds unbelievable but there are many examples that you shouldn't ignore. BLM considers all democratically
      created solutions to be "white man" solutions. Only solutions coming from BLM are acceptable</p>

    <p>Consider the

        claims at Kansas city VA medical center</a>. Hundreds of BLM supporters are calling for the complete replacement
      of VA management and an investigation into claims of racism for the last 10 years. Black people claim to be afraid
      to speak out for fear of being disciplined.
    </p>

    <p>Black employees at the VA are protected by the "NO FEAR ACT". Black employees at the VA have the <a target="news"
        href="https://www.va.gov/ORM/HPP.asp">Office of Resolution Management, Diversity & Inclusion</a>. Their only job
      is to deal vigorously and seriously with discrimination issues

      was created for black people to handle issues of discrimination.Any report of discrimination against black people
      are taken very serioussly and vigorously researched by . The form is very short. There is no excuse for 100 black
      people so far to claim discrimination now. This protest is complete nonsense and demonstrates black privilege.</p>

    <p>The simple fact is that black people are so racist against white people, they will never accept any solution
      except complete replacement of management with BLM approved managers.</p>

    <p><span class="hilite">Black people are not looking for a democratic or fair solution.

    <h2>Black privilege</h2>
    <p>Black people claim "white privilege" but there is very little or no proof that it exists.</p>

    <p>What can be easily proven is "Black privilege":</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Meer mention of black, demands immediate attention within government institutions, educational institutions,
        businesses and by all Americans. In fact, mentioning other protected groups such as women, lgbtq and others. The
        only unprotected group is white.</li>
      <li>A few years ago, a colleague kicked in a door with a minor reprimand. A white man would have been fired
        immediately.</li>
      <li>Billions $ (if not trillions) spent to address black (and other) equity issues over the years.</li>
      <li>Flagrant breaking of the law without prosecution:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>OJ Simpson</li>
        <li>Extortion: There are thousands of cases such as taco bell face mask incident. I have personal knowledge such
          as my local farmers market being closed because they would not allow any type of political statement. The city
          revoked their permit because they would not support BLM.</li>
        <li>Attempted murder: There are thousands of cases. For instance, the poisoning of 3 police officers by shake
          shack employees with bleach. The officers were force to accept this as accidental improper cleaning of the
          machine that holds 100 servings but no one else got sick.</li>
        <li>Denying Americans access to public property: protest zones, taking over police precints, Protesting on
          freeways, protesting without permits, ...</li>
        <li>Destroying and defacing property.</li>
        <li>Various acts of violence such as setting fire, throwing rocks, ...</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Immediate firing of police.</li>
      <li>Local and state government immediate capitulation to black demands.</li>
      <li>Rewrite history that black people deem disparaging.</li>
      <li>Book burning is next. Currently removing statues, memorials and symbols that black deem is disparaging without
        consideration for anyone else. </li>
      <li>Speaking against BLM is met with immediate retaliation. </li>
      <li>A web search would easily return results in the thousands.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of the 800,000 police officers, very few officers choose to take someones life each
      year. For unarmed suspects, the number goes down by around a factor of 10.
      While these numbers are tragic, they tell us that officers
      make the correct decision most of the time in a situation that is
      extremely fluid.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">My conclusions from my research</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Like many others in the world, I am truly outraged by the death of George Floyd.
        The officer who murdered George floyd deserves to be held responsible but this does not mean all officers should
        pay for the offenses of a few bad cops.
      </li>

      <li>Some racism will always exist. We must stop proving systemic racism by a single incident.</li>

      <li>Our belief in systemic racism is stronger than our belief in god.
        We take both on complete faith but neither
        can be proved or disproved with the available facts.
      </li>

      <li>I now believe systemic police racism is being blamed for the underlying problem.
        Instead of racism, I believe that both the police and the black community are caught in a
        constant cycle of violence, fear, distrust and disrespect.
        This will only end when both sides become "we" instead of you and me.
        5% of every officers time needs to be spent in real community activities
        without weapons.
      </li>

      <li>To my amazement, racially motivated police killing black people
        is now a complete myth. 800,000 officers being blamed for
        30 unarmed black deaths per year.
      </li>

      <li>Eliminating all racism is impossible
        but we should never stop trying.
        The current approach no longer helps and we need a new approach.
        The proposed police reforms will put officers in more danger than ever.
        As black lives matter puts it, 5 black people per million were killed by officers
        compared to 1 white per million but they fail to mention that 331 officers per million
        were feloniously murdered during that same time frame. It's 66 times safer
        to be black than a police officer.
      </li>

      <li>"black lives matter" is NOT about saving black lives.
        Outlaw guns and you would save over 8000 black lives
        per year that are murdered by guns.
      </li>

      <li>Now is the time for black leadership. A leader who can heal the anger and frustration.
        A leader who can say what must be said.
        A leader who is impartial and will seperate fact from fiction.
        A leader who can restore the dream.
        "Black lives matter" is now an excuse for black people to remain a victim.
      </li>

      <li>The NIH, universities and colleges are failing us.
        The NIMH director (part of NIH) stated that the NIH only supports research that
        is part of the solution rather than part of the problem. This has lead to such
        misleading research (listed at the end) that the media is using as the basis for the
        their reporting. Additionally, universities and colleges are overrun
        with racial equality programs so they can say systemic racism exists within their organizations.
      </li>

      <li>systemic racism within the police force is completely faith based by black people.
        There is no evidence to prove or disprove it. I suspect that
        systemic racism no longer exists (psychology terms

        ).
      </li>

      <li>Hearts and minds have dramatically changed over the years
        but no one is willing to acknowledge that fact.
        We need to look at racism with fresh eyes.
        Adding inequality by the government has brought us as far as it can.
        We need to heal the hate and frustration that has festered
        in victims for so many years.
