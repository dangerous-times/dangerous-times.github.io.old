    <p>Email or phone in the following message to your congress people. Feel free to change the message because it must represent your feelings. Instructions follow the message.</p>
    
    <p>I would like to build a list of congress people who are unwilling to defend the Constitution. Please email defend-constitution@protonmail.com their names if your congress people do not respond in a couple of weeks or they refuse to defend the constitution.</p>

    <div style="border: 3px solid black; padding-left: 2ch; padding-right: 2ch;">
    <p>Dear congress person,</p>

    <p>This is to put you on notice that you swore to support and defend the Constitution. Please include defend-constitution@protonmail.com in your response because they are collecting responses. We would like to know in the next 5 days when you plan to start defending the Constitution and what actions you will be taking to defend it. </p>

    <p>Portland Oregon has been ignoring the 14th amendment for over 100 days. Specifically "nor shall any state deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws". People and businesses are not being equally protected. It's time that all congress people fulfill their only true obligation of office, to support and Defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. Clearly the Oregon government is a domestic enemy of the Constitution.</p>

    <p>All the anger today stems from the Constitution. Black Lives Matter claims discrimination. Everyone else wants "equal protection of the laws".</p>

    <p>You were required to sign your federal oath of office because you will break promises. You oath must never be broken. Unlike any other oath of office, your oath says "all enemies, foreign and domestic". You signed this legally binding contract with all the people regardless of their state and you do this without any reservation. We demand you support and defend the Constitution in all 50 states even if it makes you unpopular with your constituents. If you are unwilling to honor your oath to support and defend the Constitution, then we demand that you resign immediately.</p>

    <p>Defenders of the Constitution, Kyle Rittenhouse and President Donald Trump, set an example that all of congress failed to follow. In fact, they came under fire by some congress people for their actions. They came to the aid of their neighbors to protect their neighbors Constitutional rights from domestic enemies. Every congress person should be ashamed that they did not take a single action to defend the Constitution. Not even a word of disapproval to all domestic enemies.</p>

    <p>Especially heinous is Speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi's actions. She organized the symbolic gesture "taking a knee" in the House of Representatives but does nothing to defend the constitition. She's 3rd in line for the presidency yet she was silent about the illegality and unconstitutionality of the San Jose California highway 101 protest. She failed Portland and Seattle because these cities will be bankrupt from the lawsuits seeking restitution from their reckless and negligent behaviour. The mayors could be charged with reckless homicide.</p>
    
    <p>You call yourself honorable. The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico has over 3 million U.S. citizens that are denied representation in congress. Where is your honor when California's 4 million undocumented immigrants (illegal) are represented by 2 senators and 5 extra representatives.</p>

    <p>Items that must be addressed immediately:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Every congress person must reconfirm their signed oath to support and defend the Constitution from this time forward without hesitation. We demand the immediate resignation for those who are unable to support and defend the constitution.</li>
        <li>Every congress person must take a knee for "all lives matter". Every congress person owes "The People" more than an appology but we will settle for this symbolic gesture that our lives also matter. </li>
        <li>Each congress person will speak to their constituents and tell them unlawful protesting will not be tolerated. Martin Luther King dreamed of equality and the law is about treating everyone as equal.</li>
        <li>Each congress person will speak to their constituents about the available tools to insure their rights have been protected. Violence and anger rarely solves problems. Protesting is one tool but you also have agencies that protect your rights. If they fail, then contact your congress people. Consider the protest at the Kansas City VA medical center where they claim 100 race discrimination complaints. There are 6 tools to resolve these complaints. ORMDI, "no fear act" and EEOC to research and resolve the complaint. 2 senators and 1 representative to insure the decisions were fair and complete.</li>
        <li>Each congress person will speak to the elected officials in their state about their oath and their responsibilities. They must be told that infringements on the Constitution will no longer be tolerated.</li>
        <li>Kyle Rittenhouse deserves a letter of thanks from the entire congress for reminding them that defending the constitution is an obligation. He has lost his freedom because he chose to defend the Constitution and this is the very least you can do for him.</li>
        <li>The House ethics committee must review the inappropriate actions that allowed the Constitution to be ignored and take the appropriate action to insure this never happens again.</li>
        <li>Congress must write a "protestors rights and obligation" form and require all protestors read and sign this document. Constitutional education would have avoided many of the serious crimes. Protestors must understand Racism is legal but discrimination is unconstitutional. Peaceful protests is not guaranteed by the constitution. Lawful protesting is guaranteed. Protestors are afflicted by motivated justification. By eliminating their misguided bias, they are less likely to be a problem. </li>
        <li>For many years and far more often than any other state, California flagrantly ignores the Constitution when it doesn't suit it's cause. Congress must unanamously censure Senator Diane Feinstein, Senator Kamala Harris and all 53 California representatives for their long standing violations of the Constitution. They must take action starting immediately to remedy these infringements of the Constitution. As an attorney in California, CA Attorney General and San Francisco DA, Senator Kamala Harris is well aware of the infringements taken by California but has never taken any action to correct these infringements. Even as recently as this year, she witnessed the San Jose highway 101 protest where the state (CHP) stated they would only escort the protestors from the highway. Several protestors committed felony false imprisonment with impunity. Various other laws were also broken with impunity. If equal protection of the laws truly applies, then anyone can now march on California highways with impunity.</li>
        <li>Representative Nancy Pelosi needs to be replaced as speaker of the house with someone who is honorable.</li>
        <li>Congress needs to form a taskforce to address black victimhood that must include people like Candace Owens. Black people are obviously angry and many resort to violence to solve their problems (e.g. CDC says #1 cause of death under 40 is murder). "Systemic racism" is a hoax created by Obama ansd Biden. Congress people may request evidence from blackliesmatter@protonmail.com. As seen above in the Kansas City VA medical center incident, many are not aware of the services available to fight discrimination. "motivated reasoning" leads them to false conclusions. For instance, black people believe that racism is discrimination. Racism is disrespectful but not legally punishable. Using the N word in an office will only result a discussion with the offender while many black people expect a severe punishment. Far more black people than white could receive that punishment. Black people are far less accustomed to being culturely correct as can be seen on TV shows like "Greys anatomy" where white racial slurs continue to be used but black racial slurs are avoided at all cost.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>defend-constitution@protonmail.com and I look forward to hearing from you on the actions you will be taking to defend the Constitution. </p>
    <p>Regards, a very angry constituent.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Sadly, sending a message to congress people cannot simplified because they want you to make an effort that ensures you are committed to your message.</p>

    <p>Steps to come soon.</p>
